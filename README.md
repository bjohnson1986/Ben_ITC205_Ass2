My individual development repository for the team ITC205 Assignment 2.
=======
Team Purpose
=====================================================================================================


This team has been established as a means to develop stronger teamwork skills among its members as well as to learn how to correctly, and efficiently, complete version control teamwork tasks. The team will strive to achieve the best results possible in the assessment tasks by working together and pushing each other to complete work to a high standard.

By completion, each team member should feel more confident and comfortable working in a team environment, especially one which involves members who are a large distance apart. Additionally, team members will feel confident in their version control skills, which will be a valuable asset in the future.



Duration and Time Commitment 
=====================================================================================================


The teamwork assignment is due on 28/08/15. This means that in total, this is roughly a 7 week project. At the end of the second week, an initial 'engagement task' is to be completed meaning that after this, the bulk of the project will be completed over 5 weeks.

Each member has agreed that meetings will take place on a weekly basis to ensure work is completed evenly up until the due date. It has also been agreed that random meetings may take place where necessary.

Each team member's personal time commitment on a weekly basis won't be established. Each member will simply work on the project for as many hours as they deem necessary each week to get their share of the work for that week completed.



House Rules
=====================================================================================================


The house rules consist of rules that are designed to keep friction between team members to a minimum. As such, it is desired that each team member abides by these rules at all times when working with other team members.

Firstly, no offensive language. Just because one person finds something acceptable, does not mean that everyone does. 

Secondly, always tell the truth. Nothing is more detrimental to team work than finding out a team member has not done what they said they have. This brings down both team moral and team productivity. It is best for everyone to find out the truth right away rather than after an untruth has been told.

Thirdly, no racial or religious slurs. These slurs are based on discrimination. Discrimination has no place in any situation, especially the work place. Racial and religious slurs can only lead to division of team members.

Finally, always give and receive criticism professionally and not personally. If a team member has made a mistake, they need to be corrected. The person giving the criticism should do so in a professional manner, simply explaining where the mistake was made and how it can be fixed. The person receiving the criticism should in no way take it personally, and use this experience to further improve their professional abilities.



Scope
=====================================================================================================


The scope of this project is to take a given code baseline and make it comply with the Java Coding Standards. 

Adding any extra functionality to the program is considered to be outside the scope.

Desired End Result
=====================================================================================================


The desired end result is quite simple: Work together efficiently to achieve the best results possible in our assignment submission.

When the project is complete, all members should feel strongly about their ability to perform at a high level in a team environment. Communication skills will have been improved as well as each member having a strong understanding of what is invloved with this kind of commitment.

Additionally, team members will have gained first hand knowledge and valuable experience in version control methods.



Supporting Resources
=====================================================================================================


There are three main resources for this task. Firstly, there is the Java Coding Standards supplied in the Assignments folder. This document provides the standards for Java that must be adhered to.

The second resource is the lectures and lecture material. These can help team members further understand specific topics relating to the task.

Finally there is the Eclipse documentation. As Eclipse is the chosen IDE of the task, any help needed in using Eclipse may be found in the documentation.



Reporting Plan
=====================================================================================================


The team, as required, has established a much faster form of communication - the use of WhatsApp. Through WhatsApp, task progress can easily be reported to each member in a timely fashion. In addition, we can use this form of communication as an easier way to set up meetings more efficiently.

The mentioned team meetings can be thought of as a weekly report from each member in regards to how much progress they have made/what activites they have performed over the week.

As our lecturer, James Tulip, is the one who will ultimately decide on the quality of our work, it may be necessary from time to time to report to him any problems, issues or questions that we may have.

Deliverables
=====================================================================================================


There are two main deliverables for this project

Assignment 1 or Engagement Task - All components to be completed by 24/07/15
Assignment 2 - All components to be completed by 28/08/15
The components necessary to deliver on these two assignments can be found in the assignmnent documents located in the student resources folder.
